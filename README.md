# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analytics Project

## Project Overview
Build a realistic, end-to-end data analytics platform that predicts customer churn and helps understand customer behavior, using simulated data and real data engineering/analytics tools.

## Why?
- Retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones.
- Understanding churn helps improve products, services, and revenue.
- This project demonstrates real-world data engineering and analytics skills.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
- CSV files (for data storage and sharing)
- SQL (for querying and analysis)
- Git & GitHub (with Git LFS for large files)

## Project Structure
- `data/` - All CSVs (raw/generated)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks (optional)
- `scripts/` - Python scripts

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the scripts and notebooks for data generation, cleaning, and analysis.
